===
sharing without internet

1. Local Storage and Offline Caching

Web apps can use local storage, IndexedDB, or Service Workers (a feature of progressive web apps or PWAs) to cache web content locally.
This allows apps or websites to offer a seamless experience even in the absence of an internet connection.

A news app can cache ??

2. Bluetooth
Bluetooth allows nearby devices to communicate wirelessly over short distances. Apps can transfer files, text, or other content to another device using Bluetooth, without needing an internet connection.

3. Wi-Fi Direct
Wi-Fi Direct enables devices to connect to each other directly via Wi-Fi, without needing a router or internet connection. It is a peer-to-peer connection method.
This technology can be used for transferring files, sharing content, or even playing multiplayer games.

4. Near-Field Communication (NFC)
NFC is a short-range wireless communication technology that allows devices to exchange data when they are brought within close proximity (usually a few centimeters).
NFC can be used to share links, contact information, or small pieces of content between devices without an internet connection.

5. Ad-Hoc Networking
Some apps use ad-hoc networks to establish direct communication between devices.
Apps like AirDrop on Apple devices or Nearby Share on Android devices use this approach for sharing content such as photos, links, and files between devices.

6. Mesh Networks (for Larger Groups)
In certain scenarios, such as festivals or large events, devices may form a mesh network where they communicate with each other directly (without requiring internet) to share content.

### Wayback Machine & Google Website Cache Go Offline

Information has a price as much as water, gas and
electricity does. As Floridi notes, ‚Äú[n]obody pays for yesterday‚Äôs newspaper or the wrong kind of
information‚Ä¶ Information has economic value because of its usefulness‚Äù (2010, p.90). But is
information a resource that is managed in the same way as, say, gas or water?
